            <h2>What we are meant to do</h2>
            <p>Our client, EatEZ, is a meal delivery organization for seniors. They deliver meals in containers with both cold and hot foods. They also accommodate the dietary restrictions of their recipients.<br><br>However, their volunteers that handle deliveries have found it difficult to deliver the meals. They have also faced the problem that the meals at certain temperatures are not delivered at the right temperatures: hot foods become cooler, and cold foods become warmer. So, the meals delivered to seniors do not arrive at the correct temperature.<br><br>They have also faced the problem that they may deliver a meal to the wrong person. This could prove dangerous as some seniors may have dietary restrictions as a result of allergies.</p>
            <p>As such, we were tasked with creating a container to properly regulate the temperatures of the meals that will be delivered by EatEZ. The container must be easy to carry, easy to open, keep warm food at upwards of 60&deg;C, keep cool foods below 4&deg;C, maintain that temperature for several hours, prevents/reduced spillage, and be identifiable to know the recipient and/or their dietary restrictions. It must also be able to fit two containers that measure 9.25 inches in length, 6.5 inches in width, and 2.75 inches in height.</p>
