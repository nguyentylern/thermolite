            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>When creating our product, we first had to create several ideas. Of our ideas, we produced a rough prototype. This first prototype created a plan to what our final prototype would be. It would have had a cloth or cotton exterior, a cardboard structure, and bubble wrap and aluminum foil in the interior.<br><br>To create this prototype, we took a cardboard box and shortened its length to better fit one container because be had yet to have a conception that it should fit two of the containers. After which, we implemented a divider and closed off any gaps at the edges or corners of the box to ensure there would not be any spillage. Finally, we added a handle, composed of a coil of aluminum foil wrapped with cloth, attached to the box at both long sides, reaching over the top.<br><br>For the insulatory requirements (cloth, cardboard, bubble wrap, and aluminum foil), we were inspired by the multi-layer insulating mechanism of the polar bear. The polar bear has (from outermost to innermost) transparent guard hairs, an underfur, darkly pigmented skin, and blubber. The inclusion of several layers that help a polar bear retain its warmth helped us understand that multiple layers of insulatory materials would also help in regulating the temperature of the meals within our container. Thus, the multiple layers of insulation of a polar bear inspired us to include several layers of insulation in our product.</p>
