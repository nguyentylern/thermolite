            <h2>Our Creation</h2>
            <p>Our final creation is similar to our first prototype. However, it features a falp that covers the entire opening, a handle of nylon attached directly to the flap, and it is without the exterior cloth that we had planned to include. It is a cardboard box with a folded piece of cardboard attached to one of the original folds to create a flap. Bubble wrap covers the interior except for the top. On top of the bubble wrap, there is aluminum foil. Like said previously, this takes inspiration from a polar bear's thermal regulation because both have multiple layers of material that help regulate temperature. The insulation is held in place with tape. The handle is made up of three nylon strings, attached directly to the flap with hot glue and tape. Should a divider be needed to reduce heat transfer between two meal containers, a piece of cardboard can be inserted lengthwise.<br><br>This solution is able to fit the containers of the specified size. It also is easy to carry, easy to open, and secure. Also, given the results in our first prototype when only bubble wrap was used (the third worst material in our initial test in the plastic container), our final creation should perform better because it also has aluminum foil (the second best material in our initial test). It is also individualizable because, should it be needed, someone could write on the exterior cardboard or apply a sticker that would allow the carrier to easily identify the contents or recipient of the package.</p>
